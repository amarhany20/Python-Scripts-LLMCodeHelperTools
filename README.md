_# LLM Coding Assistant

## Introduction
The **LLM Coding Assistant** is a collection of scripts designed to assist developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs). These tools simplify various tasks in software development, making workflows more efficient and structured.

## Tools Included
This repository will contain various scripts that help automate and streamline different aspects of coding with LLMs. The tools available are:

1. **Create Structure from JSON** (`create_structure.py`): A script that generates a folder and file structure based on a JSON definition.

# *Tools Explanation:* 
## **1. Create Structure from JSON**

### **Description**
This script takes a JSON file containing a structured list of directories and files, then creates them in a specified location. It helps developers quickly set up project structures without manually creating directories and files.

### **Features**
- Reads a JSON file defining the folder structure.
- Creates directories and files as specified.
- Ensures that all parent directories exist before creating a file.
- Useful for initializing new projects with predefined structures.

### **How It Works**
1. The script reads from a JSON file (e.g., `structure.json`) that contains a list of directory and file paths.
2. It processes the list and creates the corresponding directories and files at a specified location.
3. If a directory does not exist, it is created automatically.
4. Files are created as empty placeholders.

### **Example JSON Input (`structure.json`)**
```json
[
    "/src/",
    "/src/main.py",
    "/README.md",
    "/requirements.txt",
    "/setup.py"
]
```
### How to Use
1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

2. Save the JSON file
Save the above JSON as structure.json in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script
Execute the script using:

```bash
python create_structure.py
```
This will create the folder structure inside the specified output directory.

4. Customize the Output Directory
If you want the structure to be created in a different location, modify this line in create_structure.py:

```python
base_directory = "output_directory"  # Change this path as needed
```
